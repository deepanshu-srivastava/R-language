#Program to perform mathematical operation on two vectors


a = c(1:5) 
# First Vector containing elements between 1 to 10 
b = c(6:10) 
# Second Vector containing elements between 11 to 20 

c = a+b 
# Adding both vectors 
print(c) 

d = a-b 
# Subtracting both vectors 
print(d) 

e = a*b 
# Multiplying both vectors 
print(e) 

f = a/b 
# Dividing both vectors 
print(f)
