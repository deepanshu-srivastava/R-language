"R" == "r" 
"R" == "R" 
# Here == means 'is equals to' 
# Here R is not equals to r, that's why it is false 
# and R is equals to R, that's why it is true 

"R" != "r" 
# Here != means 'is not equals to' 
# Here R is not equals to r, that's why it is true 

20 >= 30
# Here >= means 'greator than and equals to ' 
# Here 20 is not greator than 30, that's why it is false 

20 <= 30 
# Here <= means 'lesser than and equals to ' 
# Here 20 is lesser than 30, that's why it is true
