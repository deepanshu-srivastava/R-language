#Program to implement Vectors

a = c(1:10) 
# Here c stands for 'combine', it is used for creating vectors. 
# The colon(:) between 1 and 10 will automatically make a vector of all numbers between 1 and 10 
print(a) 

b = a * 5 
# Here the entire vector will be multiplied by 5 
print(b) 
c = a ^ 2 
# Here the entire vector will have power 2 
print(c)


OUTPUT-
